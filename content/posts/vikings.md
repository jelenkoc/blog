* They were pretty ferocious when they attacked the abbey of Lindisfarne in 793 AD. Finding rich pickings along the coasts of Anglo-Saxon England, they did a lot of raping and pillaging.

  They conquered the Shetlands, Orkneys, Hebrides and the Isle of Man. They founded a settlement where Dublin now stands in 841 AD.

  They raided monasteries, churches and towns, especially those on the coast or near navigable rivers, carrying off valuables and slaves.

  They assembled the Great Heathen Army and in 865 invaded East Anglia. In 867 they captured York. They were defeated by King Alfred of Wessex at Edington, Wiltshire, in 878. Gradually the Danelaw, that eastern sector of England under Viking/Norse/Danish rule, was limited.  Danish king Cnut was on the English throne from 1017–35, when Anglo-Saxons were in political union with Denmark and Norway.

  Genetic studies however have shown that eventually they settled and intermarried with the local Celtic or Anglo-Saxon populations.
