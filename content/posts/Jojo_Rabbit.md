**Fun facts:**

* **Hitler Youth**, German **Hitlerjugend**, organization set up by Adolf Hitler in 1933 for educating and training male youth in Nazi principles. Under the leadership of Baldur von Schirach, head of all German youth programs, the Hitler Youth included by 1935 almost 60 percent of German boys. On July 1, 1936, it became a state agency that all young “Aryan” Germans were expected to join.

* Like all prestigious Nazi institutions, there were racial checks put in place to ensure only the creme de la creme (for a lack of a better word) of the German society, aka the Aryans, were admitted into the organisation. This vetting period began at 10, and if you were a true Aryan in the eyes of the National Socialists, you were admitted at 13 and graduated at 18. You were expected to be an elite of Nazi society, show to the world why the Germans were the greatest race on Earth. It truly did brainwash a lot of kids, and gave Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and so many others the power to control the youth and shape Germany for the future.

* The Hitler Youth were used to spy on religious classes, Bible studies and other youth organisations.
* As the war deepened and Germany was running out of men, Hitler Youth were used to fill some positions normally associated with the military within Germany. They were used to supplant the local **Volkssturm** (local militia) units in some places. They manned anti-aircraft guns, as previously noted in another answer.

  Some, even though still children, were formed into actual military units in the closing months of the war and were expected to fight to the death.

* One battle in the taking of Berlin had a unit of Hitler Youth helping defend the Reichstag (symbolically, thought of by Germans the same way Americans think of the U.S. Capital building). By most accounts they fought fanatically to the death there. Casualty estimates on the Soviet side run as high as 10,000 in the taking of that building. While records are sketchy, there is no doubt it was a bloodbath, and kids were doing the killing.
