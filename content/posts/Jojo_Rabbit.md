**Fun facts:**

* **Hitler Youth**, German **Hitlerjugend**, organization set up by Adolf Hitler in 1933 for educating and training male youth in Nazi principles. Under the leadership of Baldur von Schirach, head of all German youth programs, the Hitler Youth included by 1935 almost 60 percent of German boys. On July 1, 1936, it became a state agency that all young “Aryan” Germans were expected to join.

* Like all prestigious Nazi institutions, there were racial checks put in place to ensure only the creme de la creme (for a lack of a better word) of the German society, aka the Aryans, were admitted into the organisation. This vetting period began at 10, and if you were a true Aryan in the eyes of the National Socialists, you were admitted at 13 and graduated at 18. You were expected to be an elite of Nazi society, show to the world why the Germans were the greatest race on Earth. It truly did brainwash a lot of kids, and gave Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and so many others the power to control the youth and shape Germany for the future.

* The Hitler Youth were used to spy on religious classes, Bible studies and other youth organisations.
* As the war deepened and Germany was running out of men, Hitler Youth were used to fill some positions normally associated with the military within Germany. They were used to supplant the local **Volkssturm** (local militia) units in some places. They manned anti-aircraft guns, as previously noted in another answer.

  Some, even though still children, were formed into actual military units in the closing months of the war and were expected to fight to the death.

* One battle in the taking of Berlin had a unit of Hitler Youth helping defend the Reichstag (symbolically, thought of by Germans the same way Americans think of the U.S. Capital building). By most accounts they fought fanatically to the death there. Casualty estimates on the Soviet side run as high as 10,000 in the taking of that building. While records are sketchy, there is no doubt it was a bloodbath, and kids were doing the killing.
* **Francis Joseph Sheeran** (October 25, 1920 – December 14, 2003), known as Frank "The Irishman" Sheeran, was an American labor union official who was accused of having links to the Bufalino crime family. Sheeran was a leading figure in the corruption of unions by organized crime. He was sentenced to a 32-year prison term and served 13 years

* They were pretty ferocious when they attacked the abbey of Lindisfarne in 793 AD. Finding rich pickings along the coasts of Anglo-Saxon England, they did a lot of raping and pillaging.

  They conquered the Shetlands, Orkneys, Hebrides and the Isle of Man. They founded a settlement where Dublin now stands in 841 AD.

  They raided monasteries, churches and towns, especially those on the coast or near navigable rivers, carrying off valuables and slaves.

  They assembled the Great Heathen Army and in 865 invaded East Anglia. In 867 they captured York. They were defeated by King Alfred of Wessex at Edington, Wiltshire, in 878. Gradually the Danelaw, that eastern sector of England under Viking/Norse/Danish rule, was limited.  Danish king Cnut was on the English throne from 1017–35, when Anglo-Saxons were in political union with Denmark and Norway.

  Genetic studies however have shown that eventually they settled and intermarried with the local Celtic or Anglo-Saxon populations.
* They were excellent fighters but their early successes were aided by their mobility. Their shallow draft boats allowed them to swiftly travel up rivers and raid areas and leave before the locals could ever gather a sufficient military force to counter them. They were ferocious enough to take territory away from the English and establish the Danelaw in the northeastern part of England all the way to the Thames and then take the throne of England.

  They also were able to take Normandy in France from the French. They later captured and ruled Sicily as well as a significant part of Russia.
* The Viking societies thought of “white christ” as another god, and generally considered that different places might have different gods. Some thought that the christian God was a jealous god because he didn’t accept any other gods.

  The spread of Christianity to the Nordic countries was very gradual. The first Church was build in Hedeby in the Danish mainland, which was also the largest trading town in Scandinavia at the time. Later more churches were build in major towns, and through the organized church the bishops and priests gradually gained power.

  But all of the north was not turned Christian, Harold Bluetooth allegedly converted the Danish to Christianity, however his own son Sweyn Forkbeard reversed that. And then Sweyn’s son Canute the Great had a very liberal view of it, officially claiming to be Christian, but heavily employing the Joms Vikings, a fanatical pagan sect.

  The majority of the population gradually converted to Christianity due to the power and stability it offered in the middle ages, I don’t believe women converted because it gave them more power or better rights, Viking women could divorce, were priests and were chieftains part of the time, something that was unheard of in the middle ages.

  The last remnants of Nordic faith probably didn’t get fully removed until the Black Plague, which boosted the power of the catholic church immensely, as they sold the black plague as a punishment from God, and the survivors being the chosen ones. It solidified their grip on Europe.
