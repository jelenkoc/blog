* **Jimmy Hoffa** (born February 14, 1913, Brazil, Indiana, U.S.—disappeared July 30, 1975, Bloomfield Hills, near Detroit, Michigan), American union leader who served as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1957 to 1971 and was one of the most controversial labour organizers of his time.
* Hoffa used Sheeran as his guy for dirty jobs, including the assassination of disobedient union members and members of rival unions threatening the Teamsters' area of interest
* After being found guilty of his crimes, Hoffa was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He went to prison in 1967, but released after only four years. Hoffa had arranged a pardon agreement with president Richard Nixon. One of the conditions was that he resign as union president.
*  For the support of the IBT for reelection as a president, Nixon was allegedly paid $1 million or more to release Hoffa.
* After his release, Hoffa began trying to reclaim control of the Teamsters, and mobsters reportedly feared that he would be willing to cooperate with authorities. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa disappeared and was never seen again. So, according to Sheeran’s explanation, Bufalino and other mafia bosses decided to have Hoffa murdered. Bufalino was never accused for Hoffa’s murder.
* Hoffa’s son, James P. Hoffa, became the president of the IBT in 1999.
* As per Corruption Perception index by Transparency International for 2018, the USA took the 21st place while Croatia is on the 60th position (less is better).
